# Excel File Splitter

**Excel File Splitter** is a Python automation tool that divides a large Excel spreadsheet (e.g., 150,000+ rows) into multiple smaller `.xlsx` files, each with a styled header and preserved layout.

This tool is useful for handling large datasets, reducing file size, and improving manageability for clients or end-users.

```bash
python excel_splitter.py -i ./products.xlsx -n 15 --dry-run
```
